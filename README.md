Automating a small report for depart uses

1) It is important that you add the JAR files to your project. (Java mail and the Sqljdbc - for drivers)
2) The JDBC drivers are required due to that fact that I am connecting to a Microsoft Database from eclipse.
3) Modify the input.txt file as required. (The connection string information is not in here but rather in the code for security reasons)

Modify this as you wish. Information within these files has been faked.
